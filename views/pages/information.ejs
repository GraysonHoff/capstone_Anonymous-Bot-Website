          <h2>BOT INFORMATION</h2>
          <p>
            The anonymous discord bot is one of the leading discord bots on the market.
            The end product of the bot will be able to provide a plethora amount of features 
            to the user. Most discord bots specialize in one aspect. That might be playing music 
            or a different type of feature. For our bot, we plan on having many different features that 
            the user can have access to. This is going to fit the customer needs of a discord bot because 
            it's going to do more than just a normal discord bot. With the comanion site that will be made 
            for the user, they will have acess to information and commands for the bot.
            We chose this name for the bot because one of the main features will be the option 
            to change the voice of the bot. Anyone can use and implement their own discord server. 
            The bot will also have a companion website that will hold all the details of the 
            bot. This includes features, information, and a list of commands for the bot.

            The creators of said bot go to a technical college located in a small town 
            in Wisconsin. This page and project are for a capstone class. They are all 
            really close to graduating the program. Please enjoy what the rest of this site has to offer.
            If you use the bot, and have any suggestions on improvements, please feel free to 
            go to the suggestions page, and let us know! It would be greatly appreciated.
            I need to type more in this section, and I don't know what else to type. This site 
            is a work in progress as you can see. Kevin if you're reading this, please please give us a 
            good grade! We all worked hard on this and I feel like we deserve it.
