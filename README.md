## Description ##
### --------------- ###
#### The Anonymous Discord bot is one of the leading Discord bots on the market. The end product of the bot will be able to provide a pletora amount of features to the user. Most discord bots specialize in one aspect. That might be playing music or a different type of feature. For our bot, we plan on having many different features that the user can have access to. This is going to fit the customer needs of a discord bot because it's going to do more than just a normal discord bot. With the companion site that will be made for the user, they will have access to information and instructions on the bot. ####
#### We chose this name for the bot because one of the main features will be the option to change the voice of the bot. Anyone can use and implement into their own discord server. The bot will also have a companion website that will hold all the details of the bot. This includes features, information, and instructions on the bot. ####

## Installation ##

#### To have this bot, you will have to be in ownership of a discord server. This means being able to modify the contents of the server. After this is done, a user can go to our website (link will be below) and it will be able to redirect you to the installation page. This will have you login to your Discord Account. After this is finished, you will be able to select the correct server for the bot to be placed into. After that is finished, you can interact with the bot using the commands on the original website that the user visited.  ####
